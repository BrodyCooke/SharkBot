Our team has developed an electronic and autonomous chessboard that revolutionizes the way chess is experienced. Unlike standard boards, our creation offers a unique blend of manual and automated play. You can move the pieces yourself, or watch in awe as they glide across the board autonomously. This isnâ€™t just a chessboard; it's a smart, interactive platform you can play against a formidable computer opponent with several different skill levels, or challenge friends and family, whether they're in the same room or halfway across the world. Our board offers the tactile satisfaction of physical chess pieces, combined with the convenience and connectivity of digital gaming", "en-US-GuyNeural")
